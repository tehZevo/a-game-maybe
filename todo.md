- rename "equips" component to "loadout"
- don't sync position every tick, interpolate
- make it possible to buffer a "face direction" between skills
- sync velocity
- change equips to just use Stats (may also have both flat and scaled)
- move constants to base game package
- network in pygbag
- consider other serialization methods (bson?)
- fix pygbag slowness
- consider 8x8 item sprites
  - this would make rank icons very difficult
- in towns, have dialogs that warn/recommend rank (e-ss)
- game settings (difficulty/grindiness)
- make index operator on entity manipulate components
- maybe same thing on world?
- document skilleffect "target" (maybe make interface with set_target)?
- maybe use `__all__` in data
- pytmx/tiled (or other) map support - use a generator to just generate chunks based on tiled map
- track events per second sent/received
- how to handle pre-game setup period?
- refactor so server has multiple worlds and then scope all events by channel?
- after being on a floor for too long, start doing increasing dot?
- decorator called "withcomponents" that just makes components available in scope...
- add new skill effect that pushes enemies in the direction of the skill, and "carries" them with you
- tintable hair/eyes/skin
- flag for hats that hide hair, or "hat hair" sprites like maplestory
- enemy death animation (drop items immediately but disable everything and wait for anim to finish)
- docs are dusty
- damage numbers
- show disconnect icon above player head
- use separate colors for skill rank/equip grade?
- fix particles
- "safe area" players spawn in in next floor that lasts a short time
- player spawn animation, set animation to "focus" (holding weapon up or something)
- prevent walk animation when blocked by wall
- "diagonal" sprites? would look better for players but might make weapon sprites harder
- make monster spawners physical and targetable?
  - what if you want to grind though?
  - maybe make spawners have a better drop rate/better items?
- requirement of killing N mobs before progressing?
- limit number of dropped items and delete oldest
- teleporters/portals
- network sync interface which defines fields to be synced automatically
  - or at least "sync" means on spawn?
- avoid loading images on the server
- generator should make a player spawn point component, which players are spawned on by the generators spawn method
- highlight which entity the player would interact with
- hide skill slots until picked up for the first time?
  - hide skill slots that are "higher level" than the highest equipped
  - e.g. if you have a beta, show alpha and beta, but not delta +
- slime boss that splits into 4 smaller slimes multiple times (1->4->16->64)
- air mechanics
  - jumping
  - shadow (separate entity?)
  - skills that can only be used midair
  - skills that cannot be used midair
- fix skill use generating tons of stats updated events
 - maybe store stat updates per game tick and then send one StatsUpdated on the next tick>
- use eventcatalog to document events?
- maybe refactor "syncing" functionality into their respective components and make them just check for `networking` to see if we should perform syncing
- client side prediction :^)
- player visibility/chunks spawning/despawning/updates
  - as long as player is within radius, send updates
  - when player exits chunks, despawn entity
  - might be useful to keep track of entities that can be seen by each player in the server manager
- target effects should have a selection order (nearest/random)
- refactor skill effect targets to be a component on the skill entity(?)s
- make it so target effects require LOS (flag?)
- damage hits (basically a delay+repeat of damage)
- add invulnerability animation
- make ui components mountable to screen corners/edges and then use position as an offset
- improve collisions
  - remove small pixel gap on bottom/right collisions
  - fix passing through walls at high speeds
- make collision debug drawing
- knock back enemy if you do more than 10% of its hp?
  - does this mean allowing skills to be used in a certain direction?
- maybe make direction component for tileentity facing direction
  - how to handle fine-grained direction for actor though? is that even needed?
- make +y up
- separate ECS for particles so they dont slow down main world queries
  - add tileset physics to this world so we can have particles bounce off walls, etc
- reduce delay on interact (will require handling key pressed events so player cant hold to repeatedly interact)
- gold, health, mana drops: walk over them to pick them up
- skill idea: "ally bomb" (or something like that): damage enemies nearby allies (target allies, then target enemies)
- distance based delay effect (delay in seconds per unit)
- ranged attacks will feel nicer with a bit of delay (think magic claw from maple story)
