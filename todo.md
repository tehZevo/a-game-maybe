- stat bonus/scaling system based on equip grades equipped?
  - e.g. if you have at least 4/5 (suit, hat, gloves, shoes, weapon) at grade B, you get 20% boost?
  - E: 10%
  - D: 20%
  - C: 30%
  - B: 40%
  - A: 60%
  - S: 80%
  - SS: 100%
- dont show heal numbers for more than max health and dont show 0 heals either
- fix equips not persisting through floors
- buff/skill/item descriptions
- highlight stat scaling in skill descriptions
- buff that allows you to regen hp during combat
- buff that mitigates 25/50/100% of damage for N seconds (cooldown ~N*2s)
- remove move speed multiplier
- fix tile transparency when standing behind
- fix bug where you can drop your equip by pressing interact
- sound
- fix shadows lagging behind actors
- network and show cooldowns on client side
- make interact cursor not y-sorted
- damage number icons (bang for crit, plus for heal)
- damage number type for draining/restoring mp?
- impl charging
- client side prediction for pushing enemies
- make chests solid
- generator should make a player spawn point component, which players are spawned on by the generators spawn method
- show charge skill cooldown on weapon
- track events per second sent/received
- send lobbyupdated when players leave/join lobby or ready/unready
- damage hits (basically a delay+repeat of damage)
- gold, health, mana drops: walk over them to pick them up
  - breakables (pots, grass) for health/mana/gold?
- get user name before room create/join, store in config, use as default next time
- move skill to action folder
- save character creator in config
- wifi icon to show if you're connected to the server
- add on join channel? or use hello world to make the server add the client to the channel
  - that way we wouldnt have to worry about broadcast_synced
- support numpad enter
- interface for skilleffects with children that propagates targets and multipliers
- skill effect multipliers (carried to children)?
- skill effect success/failure (don't continue to children if failed)
- when text input field is displayed show keyboard icon and "Enter: Confirm; Esc: Cancel"
- desktop builds
- text field copy/paste, selection, backspace repeat, and vertical cursor
- cool scrolling bg for the menu
- create HelloLobby?
- clean up old state/room channels
- refactor handlers.. pass type and lambda/def..?
- docs on gamestates
- keymappings
- leverage pygame sprites/groups to speedup rendering?
  - means each drawable would have to track its sprites
  - could insert sorted (log(n) insert)
- Sequence skilleffect
- palettized particles
- mobdef aggro
  - aggro icon?
- make enemies turn to face target if not moving
- rpc decorators
- LookAt action?
- passives on items are just buffs on the item
- how to single target skills (e.g. enemy has target player?)
- TODO: how to disasble prediction in singleplayer mode (avoid double physics calcs)
- move main.js to assets/jsws-client.js
- item set effects? (may force players into less creative styles)
- determine items to drop based on what players have
- spritedef .flip so we don't have to rely on flipx in render...
- networking changes:
  - merge networking, syncing, and networked into one component type
  - any networkable component can .spawn() the ent
    - at which point the entity is spawned and update_server/update_client are called
- rename "equips" component to "loadout"
- how to disable pygbag #debug?
- consider other serialization methods (bson?)
- in towns, have dialogs that warn/recommend rank (e-ss)
- game settings (difficulty/grindiness)
- document skilleffect "target" (maybe make interface with set_target)?
- pytmx/tiled (or other) map support - use a generator to just generate chunks based on tiled map
- after being on a floor for too long, start doing increasing dot?
- decorator called "withcomponents" that just makes components available in scope...
- add new skill effect that pushes enemies in the direction of the skill, and "carries" them with you
- flag for hats that hide hair, or "hat hair" sprites like maplestory
- enemy death animation (drop items immediately but disable everything and wait for anim to finish)
- docs are dusty
- show disconnect icon above player head
- use separate colors for skill rank/equip grade?
- "safe area" players spawn in in next floor that lasts a short time
- player spawn animation, set animation to "focus" (holding weapon up or something)
- prevent walk animation when blocked by wall
- "diagonal" sprites? would look better for players but might make weapon sprites harder
- make monster spawners physical and targetable?
  - what if you want to grind though?
  - maybe make spawners have a better drop rate/better items?
- requirement of killing N mobs before progressing?
- teleporters/portals
- network sync interface which defines fields to be synced automatically
  - or at least "sync" means on spawn?
- avoid loading images on the server
- hide skill slots until picked up for the first time?
  - hide skill slots that are "higher level" than the highest equipped
  - e.g. if you have a beta, show alpha and beta, but not delta +
- slime boss that splits into 4 smaller slimes multiple times (1->4->16->64)
- air mechanics
  - jumping
  - skills that can only be used midair
  - skills that cannot be used midair
- fix skill use generating tons of stats updated events
 - maybe store stat updates per game tick and then send one StatsUpdated on the next tick?
- use eventcatalog to document events?
- player visibility/chunks spawning/despawning/updates
  - as long as player is within radius, send updates
  - when player exits chunks, despawn entity
  - might be useful to keep track of entities that can be seen by each player in the server manager
- target effects should have a selection order (nearest/random)
- make it so target effects require LOS (flag?)
- add invulnerability animation
- make ui components mountable to screen corners/edges and then use position as an offset
- improve collisions
  - remove small pixel gap on bottom/right collisions
- make collision debug drawing
- knock back enemy if you do more than 10% of its hp?
  - does this mean allowing skills to be used in a certain direction?
- maybe make direction component for tileentity facing direction
  - how to handle fine-grained direction for actor though? is that even needed?
- make +y up
- skill idea: "ally bomb" (or something like that): damage enemies nearby allies (target allies, then target enemies)
- distance based delay effect (delay in seconds per unit)
- ranged attacks will feel nicer with a bit of delay (think magic claw from maple story)
