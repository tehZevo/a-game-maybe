- make dungeon generator spit out "Wall" entities (1 per tileset wall for now, TODO: greedy merge with optional max size later)
- EntityEvent type that takes a Networked component include entity's id with event
- target effects should have a selection order (nearest/random)
- networking
  - commands: sent from client to server
  - events: sent from server to client
  - server has an ECS with a Server entity (or one per player?) to determine what events to send
  - client has its own ECS with a Client entity (receives events and takes the appropriate action (creating ents/components, etc))
  - client and server likely have separate components (eg client may have a "dummy physics" that just interpolates physics from server)
  - push events/commands from client/server onto a queue
  - usher events to their respective handlers (components should implement handler types)
- receive events, dump onto queue, pop off queue during update and.. do server stuff
- component for marking networked entities (store ID here!)
- refactor skill effect targets to be a component on the skill entity
- refactor skill effects to not store state
- add "target type" to target skill effects to avoid referencing player/enemy in skills themselves and to make skills user agnostic
- fix items getting stuck to player on pickup
- cache component -> entity mapping so we can find entities in constant time
- make it so target effects require LOS (flag?)
- damage hits (basically a delay+repeat of damage)
- add invulnerability animation
- icon ui component to draw equips and skills
- make ui components mountable to screen corners/edges and then use position as an offset
- use drawable in renderer
- improve collisions (remove small pixel gap on bottom/right collisions)
- make collision debug drawing
- merge solid tile rects greedily
- knock back enemy if you do more than 10% of its hp?
- make it possible to buffer a "face direction" between skills
  - does this mean allowing skills to be used in a certain direction?
- maybe make direction component for tileentity facing direction
  - how to handle fine-grained direction for actor though? is that even needed?
- fix game slowing down after some time (fixes itself when moving dungeon floors, might be caused by enemies attacking player; leak?)
  - also remidied by killing enemies
- make +y up
- ECS for particles so i can separate out particle behaviors
- reduce delay on interact (will require handling key pressed events so player cant hold to repeatedly interact)
- fix subpixel glitchiness
- make 0, 0 center of sprites
- box camera
- add ysorting to camera
- generator should make a player spawn point component, which players are spawned on by the generators spawn method
- gold, health, mana drops: walk over them to pick them up
- maybe distinction between world sprite and ui sprite
- skill idea: "ally bomb" (or something like that): damage enemies nearby allies (target allies, then target enemies)
- make targets have a filter type: "enemies" or "allies" or "self"? idk
- distance based delay effect (delay in seconds per unit)
- ranged attacks will feel nicer with a bit of delay (think magic claw from maple story)
